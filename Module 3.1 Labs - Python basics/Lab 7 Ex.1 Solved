A school teacher wants to calculate the average score of a student's quizzes. 
Write a Python program that takes the quiz scores as input until the user enters a negative score. Use the continue keyword to skip any negative scores during the calculation of the average. 
After all the scores are entered, calculate and display the average score of the quizzes.

# Initializing variables
total_score = 0
num_quizzes = 0

# Loop to input quiz scores
while True:
    score = float(input("Enter the quiz score (negative score to exit): "))
    
    if score < 0:
        break  # Exit the loop when a negative score is entered
    elif score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid score. Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
        continue  # Skip invalid scores and continue to the next iteration
    
    total_score += score
    num_quizzes += 1

# Calculating and displaying the average score
if num_quizzes > 0:
    average_score = total_score / num_quizzes
    print(f"The average quiz score is {average_score:.2f}")
else:
    print("No quiz scores entered.")
