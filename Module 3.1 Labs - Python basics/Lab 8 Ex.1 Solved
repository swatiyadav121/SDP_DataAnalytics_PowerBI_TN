A school cafeteria serves lunch to students, and the menu changes daily. Write a Python program that simulates a student's lunch selection process. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of items they want from the menu. The menu items are numbered from 1 to 5. However, if the user enters 0, the program should stop the selection process using the break keyword.
--------------------------------------------

# Initialize an empty list to store selected items
selected_items = []

# Display the menu
print("Menu:")
print("1. Item A")
print("2. Item B")
print("3. Item C")
print("4. Item D")
print("5. Item E")

# Loop for lunch selection
while True:
    selection = int(input("Enter the number of the item you want (enter 0 to stop): "))
    
    if selection == 0:
        break  # Exit the loop if 0 is entered
    elif 1 <= selection <= 5:
        selected_items.append(selection)  # Add selected item to the list
    else:
        print("Invalid selection. Please choose a valid item number.")

# Display the selected items
if selected_items:
    print("Selected items:")
    for item in selected_items:
        print(f"Item {item}")
else:
    print("No items selected.")
