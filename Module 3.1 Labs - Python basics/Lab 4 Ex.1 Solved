During a hiking trip, a group of friends decided to explore a cave. They encountered a series of tunnels with different lengths. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the length of a tunnel in meters. Depending on the length of the tunnel, the program should display a message describing the tunnel's classification:

Tunnels shorter than 100 meters are classified as "Short tunnels."
Tunnels between 100 and 500 meters are classified as "Medium tunnels."
Tunnels longer than 500 meters are classified as "Long tunnels."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting user input
tunnel_length = float(input("Enter the length of the tunnel in meters: "))

# Conditional statements
if tunnel_length < 100:
    classification = "Short tunnels"
elif tunnel_length <= 500:
    classification = "Medium tunnels"
else:
    classification = "Long tunnels"

# Displaying classification
print(f"The tunnel with a length of {tunnel_length} meters is classified as {classification}.")
