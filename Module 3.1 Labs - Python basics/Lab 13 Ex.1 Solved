Write a Python program that takes a list of integers as input and creates a new list with only the even numbers from the input list.
-------------------------------------

# Get input from the user (list of integers separated by spaces)
input_numbers = input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ").split()

# Convert the input to a list of integers
number_list = list(map(int, input_numbers))

# Create a new list with only even numbers
even_numbers = [num for num in number_list if num % 2 == 0]

# Print the list of even numbers
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
