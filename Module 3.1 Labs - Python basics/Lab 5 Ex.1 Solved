Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer. Use a while loop to calculate and display the factorial of that integer. 

The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

---------------------------------------------

# Getting user input
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

# Validating input
if n < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
else:
    # Initializing variables
    factorial = 1
    i = 1

    # Calculating factorial using a while loop
    while i <= n:
        factorial *= i
        i += 1

    # Displaying the factorial
    print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial}")
