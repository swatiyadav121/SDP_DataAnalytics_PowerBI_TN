Write a Python program that asks the user for a positive integer n. Use a for loop to generate and print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. 
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting user input
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))

# Initializing Fibonacci sequence with first two numbers
fib_sequence = [0, 1]

# Generating Fibonacci sequence using a for loop
for i in range(2, n):
    next_fib = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
    fib_sequence.append(next_fib)

# Displaying the generated Fibonacci sequence
print(f"The first {n} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:")
for num in fib_sequence:
    print(num, end=" ")
