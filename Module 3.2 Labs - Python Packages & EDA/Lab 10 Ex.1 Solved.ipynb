    "A university professor gave online lectures instead of face-to-face classes due to Covid-19. Later, he uploaded recorded lectures to the cloud for students who followed the course asynchronously (those who did not attend the lesson but later watched the records). However, he believes that the students who attend class at the class time and participate in the process are more successful. Therefore, he recorded the average grades of the students at the end of the semester. The data is below.\n",
