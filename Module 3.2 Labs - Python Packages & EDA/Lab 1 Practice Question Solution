Ex.1 Solution

import numpy as np

# Create an array with 8 evenly spaced values between 0 and 2
evenly_spaced_array = np.linspace(0, 2, 8)

print(evenly_spaced_array)


Ex.2 Solution

import numpy as np

# Create a diagonal matrix with diagonal values [5, 7, 9]
diagonal_values = [5, 7, 9]
diagonal_matrix = np.diag(diagonal_values)

print(diagonal_matrix)
